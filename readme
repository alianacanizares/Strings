What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I struggled to think about how to return the array in search
for the array based implementation so I inquired conceptual help 
(as allowed in the policies) about looping through but could not figure it 
out with the conceptual clarifications so was not able to complete
the array implementation of search.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

My search function using the pointer implementation does not correctly
handle the stress cases and therefore needs to get killed as it seems 
to enter a infinity loop.

disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your

disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express

What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

Yes because with these arrays, size must be known at call time we've
sinced we've recently learned dynamic memory which is used so this doesn't
have to be the case.
